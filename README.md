[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/jest-environment-ui5)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-environment-ui5) [![test](https://github.com/mauriciolauffer/jest-environment-ui5/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mauriciolauffer/jest-environment-ui5/actions/workflows/test.yml)

A `Jest Test Environment` for unit testing `UI5` code. Run your unit tests in a blazing fast way! Neither webserver nor browser are required. It runs in `Node.js` and uses `jsdom` to emulate browser environment.

See [Jest Test Environment](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#testenvironment-string) and [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) for more details.

## Installation

Install `jest-environment-ui5`, and `jest`, as devDependencies:

```shell
$ npm i -D jest  jest-environment-ui5
```

## Setup

Jest uses `node` as default test environment. In order to change it to a different environment, `jest-environment-ui5`, we will either have to define it in `jest.config.js` or add a `Jest Test Environment` docblock at the top of the test file. See [Jest Config](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#testenvironment-string) for more details.

`jest-environment-ui5` builds `jsdom` from a local HTML file, no webserver required. The HTML file should contain the `UI5` bootstrap, similar to this one: [ui5 bootstrap](test/fixtures/ui5-unit-test.html).

You can change the [UI5 bootstrap configuration](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/a04b0d10fb494d1cb722b9e341b584ba) as you wish, just like in your webapp. You can even open the file in a browser to see `UI5` being loaded. However, no tests will be executed.

### jest Configuration

```js
import type {Config} from 'jest';

const config: Config = {
  testEnvironment: "ui5",
  testEnvironmentOptions: {
    ui5: {
      path: "test/ui5-unit-test.html", // Path to the HTML file containing UI5 bootstrap
      timeout: 200, // UI5 load timeout in ms, default is 100ms
    },
  },
};
```

### jest DocBlock

```js
/**
 * @jest-environment ui5
 * @jest-environment-options { "path": "test/ui5-unit-test.html" }
 */

test("UI5 is loaded", () => {
  expect(window.sap).toBeTruthy();
  expect(sap).toBeTruthy();
  expect(sap.ui.getCore()).toBeTruthy();
  expect(sap.ui.version).toBeTruthy();
});
```

## Run

Run the tests with `Jest` [CLI](https://jestjs.io/docs/cli):

```shell
$ jest
```

## Don't be afraid

`jsdom` is not a real browser, but gets the job done for unit testing. All major javascript frameworks use it today: `React`, `Vue`, `Svelte`, and even our old friend `jQuery`. It has over 20M weekly downloads in [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsdom)!
